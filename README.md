This project is an analysis focused on the fictional company Pymaceutical's anti-cancer pharmaceuticals test and recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. The project output generates tables and figures needed for the technical report and summary of the study.
